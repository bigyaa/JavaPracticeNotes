# Interface
* Interface is basically a replacement for for extending classes since we can implement as many interfaces as we want in a Class. 
* Interface basically has two main components
    - Constants (By default)
    - Methods (They do not have data type)
* When we implement the **Interface** to a class then we nedd to define all the **methods** of the Interface.

# Abstract
* Abstract is similar to Interface. It is a class itself. 
* When we extend an Abstract Class to a Class, we need to define all the **methods** defined in the Abstract Class else the derived class again should be Abstract.
